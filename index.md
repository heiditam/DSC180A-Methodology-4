## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorm

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic I have covered in my domain is probably data cleaning. Banking transaction memos are very messy since they are unstructured data; there is no uniform way of entering the description of a purchase. This means there may be variants such as 'Chick-Fil-A', 'Chick-Fil-', 'Chick-Fi-', 'Chick-', etc., all pointing to the same restaurant. Sometimes, certain purchases may be more difficult to extract information out of because of online delivery services or added punctuation. For this challenge, we had to thoroughly clean the data and consider various edge cases that may occur so that we can extract the maximal amount of meaningful information as possible without overfitting. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For Quarter 2, we will use natural language processing to analyze the banking transaction memos to estimate a person's likely credit risk. One way we can do this is by using sentiment analysis in memos, observing phrases such as "late fee", "overdraft", and "returned payment". This could potentially give some insight about which accounts may have been involved in riskier spending patterns, so banks are better aware of who is less likely to reliably pay back their loan. I feel that this topic is interesting because I love understanding the semantics of words, and I've taken a few courses related to computational linguistics, including Large Language Models and Cognitive Science, and Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
If I could make a change to the current approach in my Quarter 1 Project, it would be to see everyone's approach and thought process more clearly, but I do appreciate how we are working as a team now, which involves someone setting up a baseline and then people making modifications and meeting up once or twice before the official meeting with our mentor. Ideally, we would want to be meeting in-person, but that is not exactly viable for us because one of our teammates lives over an hour driving away. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I may be interested in using topic modelling, such as LDA or BERTopic, to group memos into latent topics (e.g. bill payments, overdrafts, loan activity) to observe hidden behavioral patterns better.
